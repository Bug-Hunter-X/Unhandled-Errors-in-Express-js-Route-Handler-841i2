# Express.js Unhandled Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling in route handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks error checks for database operations and missing user data. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected responses.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling for a more robust application.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` (or `node bugSolution.js` to see the fixed version).
4. Observe the responses for various user IDs, including invalid ones or those that don't exist in the database (simulated here).
